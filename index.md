Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Ignacio, and I'm 18 years old. This blog will contain my thoughts, opinions, experiences, and rants about my interests. I have far too many hobbies and interests, so I'll share a little list of the ones I'm most drawn to, just so you know what to expect:

- Programming – mostly graphics and web
- Fishing
- Music – bands and genres
- Movies
- Fixing random stuff I find in my house or at relatives' homes
- Here's a quick bio:

I was born on June 4, 2006, in Córdoba, Argentina, but I've lived 99.9% of my life in Posadas, Argentina. My close ones say I was quite annoying as a baby and had a habit of putting my food everywhere but in my mouth. I remember having a great childhood, surrounded by love.

I discovered computers when I was 5 years old, thanks to one of my relatives who taught me how to use the family computer—not knowing it would spark one of my biggest passions. I remember spending hours browsing the internet, reading about topics such as Pokémon, Crash Bandicoot, sea criatures, and other things I found fascinating.

I quickly discovered Flash games, which created an obsession I still have with video games. The first gaming console I owned was a PlayStation 2, and the first games I played on it were Lego Batman: The Videogame, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and my personal favorite, Spiderman 3. After the PS2 came the PSP, then the Xbox 360, and nowadays, I mostly game on PC.

This early interest in technology made me take the decision of enrolling in a Technical High School to study an IT orientation an 12 years old. About that same age I discovered what programming was via a PSeInt course, which quickly scaled into web development. Nowadays I'm commited in learning Graphics Programming.
